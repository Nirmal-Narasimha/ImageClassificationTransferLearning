## Transfer Learning for Multi-Class Image Classification
- Built a multi-class image classifier for six scene categories using **transfer learning** with pre-trained models (**EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, ResNet100, VGG16**).
- Incorporated **image augmentation** (zoom, rotation, flipping), **learning rate scheduling**, **early stopping**, and **checkpointing** for improved performance.
- Achieved **90% test accuracy** and **99% AUC** on **EfficientNetB0** with fine-tuned fully connected layers using **ReLU activation, dropout, and L2 regularization**.
